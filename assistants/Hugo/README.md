# Hugo — Content Creation Assistant

Hugo helps you write and publish blog posts. He guides you from topic selection through drafting, revision, and final publication — including cross-posting to LinkedIn and Twitter.

## What Hugo Does

**Draft blog content** — Hugo takes a topic and produces structured outlines, iterates on them with your feedback, then progressively expands into full prose. He uses memory to recall previous drafts and feedback, and provides editable blocks so you can refine content directly.

**Revise and polish** — Once a draft exists, Hugo offers precise support on word choice, tone, and style. He references your previous blog posts to maintain consistency across your writing.

**Publish and cross-post** — When the post is ready, Hugo formats it for publication and handles posting (or scheduling) across your blog, Substack, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

**Search previous posts** — Look up and reference your earlier work.

## Workflow

Hugo follows a 10-step workflow from topic to published post. Each step involves human review before moving forward.

### Drafting (Steps 1–5)

1. **Topic selection** — Start from a pool of topics, either seeded by you or generated by Hugo.
2. **Outline generation** — Hugo drafts 3 possible outlines, each with sections and key points (2 levels deep).
3. **Outline refinement** — You select the best outline and provide feedback. This may iterate several times until the structure feels right.
4. **Content expansion** — Hugo researches and drafts the main points and subpoints (3 levels deep).
5. **Content review** — You review the expanded draft and provide feedback.

### Revision (Steps 6–9)

6. **Deep revision** — Hugo revises based on your feedback and goes one level deeper, producing actual phrases and sentences (4 levels deep). At this stage, Hugo references your previous blog posts to maintain consistent tone and style.
7. **Final content approval** — You review and approve the revised content.
8. **Formatting** — Hugo cleans up and formats the final content for publication.
9. **Publication review** — You review the formatted post and approve it for publishing.

### Publishing (Step 10)

10. **Publish** — The final post is published or scheduled on your blog, Substack, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
