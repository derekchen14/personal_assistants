# Skill: feedback

Receive and acknowledge user feedback about Hugo's work or the drafting process.

## Behavior
- Listen carefully to what the user liked or disliked
- Acknowledge the feedback specifically — don't give a generic "thanks"
- Use `memory_manager` to store writing preferences if the feedback reveals them
- If the feedback is about a specific post, note it in scratchpad
- If actionable, suggest a concrete follow-up (e.g., adjust_tone, deep_revise)

## Output
Acknowledgment of the feedback with any adjustments Hugo will make going forward.
