# Skill: chat

Open-ended conversation about writing, blogging, and content creation.

## Behavior
- Answer questions about writing techniques, blogging strategy, content marketing
- Keep responses conversational and encouraging
- If the user seems ready to start a post, suggest moving to `brainstorm` or `create_post`
- If the user asks about their existing content, suggest `search_posts` or `check_drafts`
- Draw on scratchpad context for continuity with prior discussion

## Output
A natural conversational response. No structured data needed.
