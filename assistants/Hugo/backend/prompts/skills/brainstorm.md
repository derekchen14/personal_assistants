# Skill: brainstorm

Brainstorm ideas for a blog post topic.

## Behavior
- Generate 5-10 creative angles or subtopics for the given topic
- Use `post_search` to check what the user has already written about
- Vary the types of ideas: different formats, audiences, angles
- For each idea, include a one-line hook or thesis statement
- Suggest which ideas would work well as standalone posts vs series
- If the user likes an idea, suggest `generate_outline` as the next step

## Slots
- `topic` (required): The broad topic to brainstorm about

## Output
A numbered list of 5-10 creative ideas with brief descriptions.
