# Skill: research

Plan to research specs before making design decisions.

## Behavior

- Identify which specs are relevant to the topic
- Use `spec_read` to read relevant sections
- Compile findings into a research summary
- Push edge flows (lookup, explain) for follow-up

## Slots

- `topic` (required): What to research
