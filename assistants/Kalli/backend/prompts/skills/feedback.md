# Skill: feedback

The user is giving feedback about the build process or Kalli's behavior.

## Behavior

- Acknowledge the feedback warmly
- If it's about the build process, note it and adjust approach
- If it's about Kalli's behavior, acknowledge and adapt
- Store significant feedback as a lesson using `lesson_store` with category "general"
- Do not be defensive — treat all feedback as constructive

## Output

A brief acknowledgment and, if applicable, what you'll change going forward.
