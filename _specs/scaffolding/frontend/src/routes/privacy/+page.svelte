              We hold onto credentials for logging into the system, such as OAuth tokens, usernames, and/or
              email addresses.

              We do *NOT* store your data uploaded from CSVs, data connected from your vendors, or data imported from third-party platforms. This information is stored in memory only during your active session and is immediately deleted upon logging out.

          <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
            <li>
              We use your information solely to provide and maintain our services. We do not sell any of
              your data to any third-party providers. Once again, we have no access to your uploaded data
              once you close the system because that data is not stored in a hard disk anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              To notify you about changes to our services or any products we offer or provide through it.
            </li>
            <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our website.</li>
            <li>
              We do use the conversation history to improve the training of our machine learning models.
              Good-faith efforts are taken to remove any PII (personally identifiable information) from the
              chat logs before any model training occurs.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not share, sell, or transfer any data imported from third-party platforms, 
              with any external entities. Any data imported is used solely to facilitate the 
              data analysis and transformation features of our Services during your session, as described in our Terms of Service. 
              Our data handling practices are designed to minimize the use and retention of your information, 
              limiting it strictly to what is necessary to provide the Services during your active session.
